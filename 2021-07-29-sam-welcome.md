## Welcome

Content with recently [solving bioinformatics](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-021-02395-y), I have turned my attention to something much simpler and decided to build a stock exchange. This is actually an idea Tom and I had a few years ago while discussing interesting ideas for student group projects. Like many fun things during my PhD, [it was left merely as an idea](https://github.com/SAMTOMINDUSTRYS/stex).

In a rare week off a few months ago, I felt inspired to adventure on some personal improvement and bought a bunch of books.
I've been eager to apply the things I have been reading about from *Clean Architecture*, *Architecture Patterns with Python* (aka. "Cosmic Python") and most recently, the "big boy"; *Designing Data-Intensive Applications*.

Turns out our five year old idea for establishing the *Sam and Tom Stock Exchange* seemed a good fit. We're likely going to need some real domain modelling and research (because neither of us are users of such a system and not at all familiar with finance technology) and we think the idea will lend well to a service-orientated architecture, which is something I would like to try out. Most interestingly, by definition a stock exchange is a data intensive system, and will throw up some challenges for ensuring transactions are robust, services can scale, and are resilient to whatever we decide to throw at it.

Tom and I thought it would be good to kick off a development log. We'll see if that turns out to be true.
